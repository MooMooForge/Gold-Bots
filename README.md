# MooMoo.io Gold Bots
This script allows you to create bots that will follow your character. The bots will have a specific name, skin and follow you around the map. The script uses the [MooMoo.js](https://moomooforge.github.io/MooMoo.js/) library to create and control the bots.

## Installation
1. Install a userscript manager extension for your browser, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Click on [this link](https://github.com/MooMooForge/Gold-Bots/releases/latest) to install the script.
3. Enjoy your bots!

## Usage

Once the script is installed and you are in the MooMoo.io game, the bots will automatically be created and will follow you around the map.

You can also use the following commands in the chat to control the bots:

- `/send`: Sends 4 more bots to the game
The send command only works if after you joined a game you activated a VPN, which makes you able to summon 4 more bots.

- `/disconnect`: Disconnects all the bots
